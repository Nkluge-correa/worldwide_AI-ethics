# Worldwide AI Ethics: a review of _200_ guidelines and recommendations for AI governance 🌐

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/533441174.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/533441174)

In the last decade, a great number of organizations have produced documents intended to standardize, in the normative sense, and promote guidance to our recent and rapid AI development. However, _the full content and divergence of ideas presented in these documents have not yet been analyzed, except for a few meta-analyses and critical reviews of the field._ In this work, we seek to expand on the work done by past researchers and create a **tool for better data visualization of the contents and nature of these documents.** We also provide our critical analysis of the results acquired by the application of our tool into a sample size of _200_ documents.

## Dash Template 🐱‍💻

Here you can find the source code used to create our _Worldwide AI Ethics_ dashboard. This panel was created using the [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-enterprise) library. All the tables that feed our dashboard (`data_en.rar`), images (`png_files.rar`), and HTML-Plotly graphs (`html_files.rar`) are available in the `data` folder (in `csv` and `parquet`). Auxiliary notebooks for creating the graphs (`make_graphs.ipynb`) and processing the text data(`principle_mining.ipynb`) are also available. We also make available the notebook we used to infer the gender of all authors in our sample (`gender_infer.ipynb`), and the notebook to create the `geojson` file that sets the boundaries of the polygons on the `Mapbox`. To render the dash app in your browser, simply run the `worldwide.py` script.
